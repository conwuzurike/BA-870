## Financial and Accounting Analytics

Primary Objective: The primary objective of this course is to introduce Questrom MSBA
students to:
- key financial and accounting (F&A) concepts
- data sources
- data analytics tools to solve real and important F&A problems

The course builds prior statistical, data science and programming courses for F&A
applications and problems. In addition, we introduce new complementary tools and data
sources to students’ analytics toolkit using Python applications and databases (including
BERT, ScikitLearn, Google Colab, WRDS, Yahoo Finance, and SEC_Edgar). The course
is designed for business-focused data scientists/analysts who will have to identify, gather,
parse, analyze and present F&A data to understand, solve and communicate solutions
for real business problems. The course is designed to be “hands on” and involves many
example applications and cases.
